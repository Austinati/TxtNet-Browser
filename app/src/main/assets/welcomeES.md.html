    <h1>Other App Features:</h1>
    <h2 id="options">Options</h2>
    <p>The options section of this app houses 2 major functions. Primarily, you can delete message history with the server once a large amount of web data has been stored. Secondly, you can choose to block incoming message notifications from the server to improve your experience with the app. We recommend that first-time users block the number that they wish to use in the app. To accomplish this, press the three dots in the top right of your screen and choose “Options.”</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT: In order to Block, Unblock, or Delete Message History, Android requires that this app be registered as the default SMS app beginning with Android 4.4. To accomplish this, choose “Set Default SMS” in Options. When you are done, press the button again to revert to your previous Messaging app.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="selectPhoneNum">Select Server Phone Number</h2>
    <p>The server phone number selection screen can be found from the overflow menu (3 dots) to the right of the search bar. In this menu, you can add new server phone numbers by pressing on the plus (+) icon, select a default phone number by tapping it, and delete a phone number by swiping left on the number's cell and selecting "Delete".</p>

    <h2 id="serverHost">TxtNet Server Hosting</h2>
    <p>TxtNet Browser empowers users to utilize their own Wi-Fi or Cellular Data connection to act as a server to other users who can connect to you through the phone number associated with your default SIM. To enable this functionality, users on Android 4.4-10 must run two adb commands once by connecting their phone to a computer over USB. On Android 11+, users may opt instead to install the Shizuku app through the Google Play store. The "Number of Webviews" refers to the amount of concurrent web requests allowed from multiple users. "Max outgoing SMS per request" specifies how many SMS messages are allowed to be sent resulting from a single web page request. A website with lots of text can exceed this limit, in which case a failure message will be sent instead.</p>
